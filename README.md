# Traffic Light Controller ‚Äì PCB Design Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and development of a **proof-of-concept traffic signal controller** using a custom-designed PCB.  
The hardware integrates an **ATmega328P microcontroller**, **RGB LEDs** for traffic light indication, and **dual 7-segment displays with driver circuitry** for countdown functionality.  
The PCB was designed using **Autodesk Eagle**, with schematic creation, component footprint integration, PCB layout, and Gerber file generation carried out as part of the workflow.

## Technical Description
The traffic light controller was designed to simulate real-world traffic management systems with countdown functionality. The project involved:  

- **Microcontroller Integration:** ATmega328P served as the core MCU for control logic and timing.  
- **Traffic Indication:** RGB LEDs were configured as red, yellow, and green traffic lights.  
- **Countdown Display:** Two 7-segment displays, driven by IC CD4511BE, were used to show a two-digit countdown timer.  
- **Power Supply Design:** Onboard regulation using L7805 (TO-252 and D2PAK variants) provided a stable 5V supply from a DC jack or screw terminal input.  
- **Passive Components:** 0603 package resistors and capacitors were used for compact and reliable circuit implementation.  
- **Switching Mechanism:** A tactile pushbutton switch was included for reset/control functionality.  

The entire workflow included schematic capture, PCB layout routing, ERC/DRC validation, and generation of Gerber files for fabrication.
